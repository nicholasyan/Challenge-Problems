**Reverse a string.**

The Basic Problem:

At first, start with just a single word:

```
e.g.    input       hello
        output      olleh
```

Some Variations:

1. Now solve the problem with a recursive solution.

3. Now reverse a string, keeping the spaces intact (ignoring them).

```
e.g.    input       I say hello world
        output      d lro wolle hyasI
```
