***The Basic Problem:***

Print the first ten numbers of the Fibonacci sequence separated by spaces.

```
0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34
```

***Some Variations:***

1. Print the *n*th term in the Fibonacci sequence recursively.

2. [By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.](https://projecteuler.net/problem=2)
