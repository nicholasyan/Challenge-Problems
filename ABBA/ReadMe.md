***The Basic Problem:***

Test if a string is in the form ABBA.

Each A and B can be a single character or an entire string. (Assume that the input string contains no spaces.)

Some examples of input in the correct form:

```
ABCCBA
catratratcat
```

Input not in ABBA form:

```
ABCBA
catrattarcat
```

As long as you can break a given word into four chunks where the outside two chunks are equal and the inside two chunks are equal, the word is in ABBA format.
