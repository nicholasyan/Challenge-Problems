# The Problem

Write a program that outputs all possibilities to put + or - or nothing between the numbers 1, 2, ..., 9 (in this order) such that the result is always 100. For example: 1 + 2 + 34 – 5 + 67 – 8 + 9 = 100.

Though the title of the article is a bit gimmicky, I nonetheless found the problem quite interesting.
