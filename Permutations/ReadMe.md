***The Basic Problem:***

Given a list of numbers from the command line, print out all possible permutations of these numbers.

For example, given the list of numbers 1 2 3, produce the following output:

```
1 2 3
1 3 2
2 1 3
2 3 1
3 1 2
3 2 1
```

(Note: Any order is acceptable, as long as you produce all of the combinations.)
