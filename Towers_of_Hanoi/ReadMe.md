***The Basic Problem:***

Write a program that prints out the steps to solve the Tower of Hanoi given some starting tower of *n* disks.

For example, for 3 disks:

```
move disk 1 to rod 3
move disk 2 to rod 2
move disk 1 to rod 2
move disk 3 to rod 3
move disk 1 to rod 1
move disk 2 to rod 3
move disk 1 to rod 3
```
