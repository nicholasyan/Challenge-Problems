# Challenge Problems

## What is this repo?

This repo is a compilation of programming problems I find particularly interesting and my solutions to them.

Some of these are interview questions I've found on the internet. This repo also serves as a method for me to practice for those questions.

## How do I practice on these problems?

The problem is listed in each subfolder's README.

## Can you write a solution to *this* problem?

Sure. Feel free to send it my way at nicholas.yan [at] tufts.edu
